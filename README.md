# Love To Travel 
An application project built using the Django framework. 
Where peoples throughout the world could post about their native land or any places that they have visited and wanted to share it with others. 
This will help the tourist to know more about any visiting places and can also help others to bring on to light about some beautiful  places which had never been visited before.
